# Creative-Joke-Generation

fix_set.py is a quick script to extract all the jokes starting with wh-question words. 
Jokes that contain some common curse words are also ignored. shortjokes.csv is the original file, 
and input_large.txt is the set of extracted jokes. For quick testing, input_small.txt contains 100 jokes. 
output.txt contains examples of the output generated by the system. gru_generation.py is the neural network 
system that generates text.
